## Hi there, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

Full-stack developer, eager to apply new technologies to create software that makes peopleâ€™s lives easier. 

With a background in hospitality, I value the fulfillment of creating meaningful and memorable experiences. My desire to make a lasting difference that is accessible to everyone is what led me to software engineering. Immersing myself into object-oriented and functional programming, multiple languages, and frameworks, evidently proved the potential of growth for the community and myself is limitless. I am thrilled at the opportunity to contribute to any project that is motivated by positively impacting our day to day lives.
